      It seems to me that other unmentioned specs of CC devices would be similar
      to those of CC1, and they would be marked with an * in the comparison
      table.
    </li>
    <li>
      CCU and CC2.1 uses the same PCB as CC2, so some of the specs of them would
      be same to those of CC2.

      "???" are the specs which I am not sure about or cannot find information
      about. If you know of any helpful resources, please message me on Discord
